### Energy system investments

Energy system investment portfolios [REF McCollum et al. 2018] were derived from six global energy-economy models (IAMs): AIM/CGE [REF Fujimori et al. 2014, Fujimori et al. 2012], IMAGE [REF Stehfest et al. 2014], MESSAGEix-GLOBIOM [REF Fricko et al. 2017, Krey et al. 2016], POLES [REF Criqui et al. 2015], REMIND-MAgPIE [REF Kriegler et al. 2017, Luderer et al. 2013] and WITCH-GLOBIOM [REF Bosetti et al. 2006, Emmerling et al. 2016]. We focus on investments under the current policies (used as each model’s baseline) and on upscaling requirements necessary for the energy system compatible with the 1.5°C target of the Paris Agreement. The models cover different types of energy technologies, including resource extraction, power generation, fuel conversion, transmission, energy storage and end-use demand services. We group these technologies into two broad sectors: fossil fuels (extraction and conversion of fossil fuels, electricity from fossil fuels without Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) technologies and hydrogen from fossil fuels) and low carbon sources (extraction and conversion of nuclear energy, CCS, electricity from non-bio renewables, hydrogen from non-fossil fuels, extraction and conversion of bioenergy, electricity transmission and distribution and storage, and energy efficiency). The investment figures were corrected for inflation (from USD 2015 to current USD) [REF World Bank].

Our analysis focuses on the near term investment needs from 2020 to 2024, taking the model average for the underlying yearly data.

Figures xxx show the total investment needs over the 5-year time period.

Figures xxx show the change in the investment needs over the 5-year time period, from the current policy baseline to the 1.5°C-compatible pathway.

Figures xxx show the average yearly investment relative to the 2018 Gross Domestic Product (GDP) [REF World Bank]. 


### Stimulus packages

International Monetary Fund (IMF) has been tracking the policy measures announced by governments in response to the COVID-19 pandemic [REF]. For this analysis, we focus on the fiscal policy responses, which span a wide range of instruments such as spending and revenue measures (primarily in the health sector, and different types of liquidity support for affected businesses and workers), equity injections, asset purchases, extra-budgetary funds, guarantees on loans, etc. We extracted data for 175 countries and the European Union, announced up to May 15, 2020. 

Countries announced their stabilization packages in different levels of detail and scope. Here we group the fiscal measures broadly into those targeted at the health sector, those aimed at supporting individuals and households, those that aim at other economic sectors (economy at large), and we pool the rest into a category of general measures. Portions of fiscal measures allocated to the *general* category are either unspecified or do not belong to one of the categories above.
